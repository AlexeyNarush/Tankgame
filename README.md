# Tankgame

This is my version of the tank game made on Python. I made it in 2019 and made it my final Python course project. In curent state game run untill players have at least one Heart 'Hp' of three with wich players start. Game made for 2 players in local PC. Project made with pygame library. Size of game window and ingame elements can be changed from settings.py file. Colors used in game can be modified in color.py file of the progect. Grid projected on ingame screen is setted in grid.py file and can be modified from there. Tanks, boxes and bulets settings can be found in files with the names of element you want to change(tank.py; box.py; bullet.py). Main file takes settings and ingame elements status from the theis files and starts the game sequense that goes untill player end it with command setted within main.py file.
